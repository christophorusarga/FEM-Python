import pycalculix as pyc

# Step 1: Create an FEA model
model = pyc.FeaModel('cylinder_with_load')

# Step 2: Define the material properties (Carbon Fiber)
carbon_fiber = pyc.Material('carbon_fiber')

# The correct method signature requires both Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio
carbon_fiber.set_mech_props(70e9, 0.1, 0.27)  # Young's Modulus in Pascals, Poisson's Ratio

# Step 3: Create a part (the cylinder)
part = model.create_part('cylinder')

# Step 4: Define the geometry of the cylinder
radius = 0.5  # 0.5 meters (50 cm) radius
height = 2.0  # 2 meters height
part.create_cylinder(radius=radius, height=height)

# Step 5: Mesh the part (discretize it into elements)
part.set_mesh_size(0.1)  # Set mesh size to 0.1 meters
part.generate_mesh()     # Generate the mesh

model.set_matl(carbon_fiber, part)

# Step 6: Define the boundary conditions
# Fix the bottom face of the cylinder (simulate it being attached to the ground)
model.apply_bc_fix('cylinder', 'face', 1)  # Face 1 is the bottom of the cylinder

# Step 7: Apply the load (500 kg steel box on top)
gravity = 9.81  # m/s^2
weight = 500 * gravity  # Weight in Newtons (500 kg * gravity)

# Apply the force on the top face of the cylinder
model.apply_force('cylinder', 'face', 2, 'z-', weight)  # 'z-' means the force is downward

# Step 8: Write the input file for CalculiX
model.write_inp('cylinder_load.inp')

# Step 9: Run the FEA simulation (You need to have CalculiX installed)
# os.system('ccx cylinder_load')

# Note: The actual running of CalculiX is done via command line. This line is an example.
